# Makeover Monday
## My Submissions to the [#makeovermonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) Data Viz Challenge

I created this repo on 2nd November 2021. At the time, I had spent a lot of time working through various online courses in data analysis and data visualization. I was at the point where I wanted to put some of those skills to practice. I had dabbled in the Makeover Monday project in the past, submitting a handful of entries as time allowed. But now I was ready to commit more time to this, and told myself I would aim to submit one project a month. Imagine my disappointment then, upon heading over to [Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk), to discover that the project has come to an end. The last challenge was published in September 2021. Such a shame! I've long been a fan of this project and the way it builds a community around data analysis and visualisation. 

So I have decided to set myself my own challenge: complete 100 Makeover Monday submissions from the archives. I have decided to take the most recent 100 challenges (since the data is no longer available for some of the earlier challenges). I'll work from the oldest to the newest, and document everything here as I go. My submissions will also be showcased on my [personal blog](https://www.surreydatagirl.com).
